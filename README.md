# ImRec:<ins>Im</ins>plicit feedback based <ins>Rec</ins>ommendation framework  

_We opensource the framework and hope it could benefit the community._

## Features

- **Aligning recommendation to Industry**
  - Global time splitting with timestamp (_Same raw source data, same results! Previous random 
    splittings suffer from **data leakage** and do not hold this property._)
  - Strictly predict future interactions.
  
- **Supporting various supervised tasks**
  - Supervised with sampled negatives by a sampling strategy
  - Supervised with all positives and negatives (_All unobserved are negatives_)
  - Self-supervised with observed interactions only

- **Unified and order-invariant grid search (GS) entry**
  - One entry for grid search and per-run of model
  - Reproduce same results no matter what order of hyper-parameters in GS
  - Results are summarized to ease your manual comparison after GS

- Personal mantenance
  - Framework consistence is ensured

Download from Google Drive: [Amazon-Vedio-Games/Food etc.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WqRAeoWWGdZplYkjS4640V7v0urNiTXg?usp=sharing)    

## How to run
`python main.py -m LayerGCN -d food`

You may specify other parameters in CMD or config with `configs/model/*.yaml` and `configs/dataset/*.yaml`.

## Best hyper-parameters for reproducibility
We report the best hyper-parameters of LayerGCN to reproduce the results in Table II of our paper as:
